    subtitle: `The romance of a crackling fire, radiant warmth and coziness. These are the reasons why we love fireplaces and solid fuel stoves. But this comfort also has a dark side that we often don't see — fine dust, soot, and gases that are inevitably released into the room during burning and handling of the fuel. Even with a perfect chimney draft, pollutants can still get into the air when stoking or cleaning. So how can you enjoy the warmth of your home and breathe clean and healthy air at the same time? The solution is a properly selected air purifier.`,

When you add wood to a stove, you usually see a small puff of smoke that quickly disappears. The problem is not what we see, but what remains. Wood smoke is a complex mixture that contains the following components:

• <b>Fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM2.5 and smaller)</b> – These are microscopic soot and ash. These particles are the most serious because they penetrate deep into the lungs and from there into the bloodstream, where they can contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular problems. Those that you don't inhale will settle in your interior as a black coating.

• <b>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</b> – Burning wood releases a variety of gases, including benzene, formaldehyde, and acrolein. Many of these are irritants or proven carcinogens.

• <b>Odors</b> –  The characteristic odor of smoke is itself a signal of the presence of these substances in the air.<br></br>

A quality air purifier in a room with a fireplace acts as a tireless guardian. It constantly monitors the air quality and when the sensor detects increased pollution (e.g. when adding fuel), the purifier automatically increases its performance and filters out pollutants before they can settle or be inhaled.

        heading: 'The Anatomy of a Smoke Purifier: Which Part Does What?',
        content: `
To effectively deal with specific stove contamination, a purifier must be equipped with a combination of several key technologies. Each of them has its own irreplaceable role.<br><br>

<b class="text-xl block mt-4">1. HEPA filter as the main barrier against soot and dust</b>
The heart of any quality air purifier is the particulate filter. To filter out smoke and soot, it is absolutely essential that it is a true (sometimes referred to as a “true”) <b>HEPA filter</b> with an efficiency class equivalent to H13.
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">

  <li><b>What it does:</b> This dense filter is made of folded microfibers and captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 micrometers (PM2.5 + fine ash).</li>
</ul>

<b class="text-xl block mt-8">2. ACTIVATED CARBON FILTER AGAINST ODORS AND TOXIC GASES</b>
While the HEPA filter takes care of solid particles, the carbon filter deals with the gaseous component of pollution.
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
  <li><b>What it does:</b> Activated carbon has an extremely porous structure with a huge internal surface area. Through a process called adsorption, it “sticks” gas molecules to itself. It is responsible for removing the unpleasant smell of smoke and neutralizing harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that the HEPA filter passes through. Winix purifiers often use advanced <b>CD (Coated Deodorization) filters</b> which are specially treated for even higher efficiency against VOCs.</li>
</ul>

<b class="text-xl block mt-8">3. PLASMA IONIZER AGAINST VOLATILE SUBSTANCES</b>
This is an add-on technology that significantly increases the efficiency of the entire gas cleaning process.
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
  <li><b>What it does:</b> Technology like Winix PlasmaWave® works on a different principle than passive filters. It actively releases positive and negative ions into the air. These ions combine with water molecules in the air to form hydroxyls (OH radicals). These hydroxyls then actively break down odors and dangerous volatile substances – such as benzene, formaldehyde, toluene and acrolein – at the molecular level, which are released when wood is burned. They accelerate the neutralization of pollutants that would take longer for a carbon filter to absorb on its own.</b>.</li>
</ul>

<b class="text-xl block mt-8">4. SENSORS AND FAN AS THE EYES AND LUNGS OF THE SYSTEM</b>
These two components ensure that the purifier works smartly and efficiently.
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
  <li><b>Dust sensor (PM2.5):</b> This is the “eye” of the purifier. It constantly monitors the concentration of solid particles in the air (not gases). Thanks to this, the purifier can run in  automatic mode – when the air is clean, it quietly saves energy. However, as soon as you open the fireplace door and smoke escapes into the room, the sensor detects this and instructs the fan to increase speed. Some purifiers are also equipped with an odor sensor.</li>

  <li><b>Fan & CADR performance:</b> The fan ensures circulation. Its power is often given as “air output” (air flow) in m³ – that is, how much air passes through it in total. However, this value alone is not enough. More important is the CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) metric . This does not say how much air the fan pumps, but how much clean air the purifier delivers back into the room (after subtracting the impurities captured by the filters). A high CADR for smoke (this value is measured separately) is key for a fireplace. It guarantees that the purifier can quickly and effectively remove impact pollution when placed on it. While the European ECARF certification confirms the overall suitability of the product for people with sensitive breathing, CADR is a direct indicator of the filtration speed of specific impurities.</li>

        heading: 'Where to (not) place the purifier',
        content: `
Logic would dictate that the purifier be placed as close to the source of the pollution as possible. But in the case of a stove, this is a bad idea.<br><br>

<b>Never place the purifier right next to a fireplace or stove.</b>  
The intense radiant heat could damage the device's plastic chassis and, most importantly, degrade the sensitive filters.<br><br>

The ideal location is in the same room, but <b>at a safe distance (at least 1.5 to 2 meters)</b>, ideally in the space between the fireplace and the place where you spend the most time (e.g. a sofa). It is important that it has enough space around it for air intake and exhaust.

        content: `
An air purifier is a great helper, but it is not omnipotent. To ensure the safe operation of your fireplace, you need to consider three other things that it will not help you with.<br><br>

<b>1. WARNING: CARBON MONOXIDE (CO)</b><br>
No conventional air purifier (not even Winix) can detect or remove carbon monoxide (CO). It is a deadly, odorless gas that is produced by incomplete combustion. The purifier removes particles and odors from the air, but it safely releases the CO.<br><br>

• <b>Recommendation:</b> It is essential to have a certified CO detector installed in every room with a solid fuel heater. It is a cheap safety measure that can save your life.<br><br>

<b>2. CARBON DIOXIDE (CO₂) AND OXYGEN</b><br>
Fire consumes oxygen (O₂) and produces carbon dioxide (CO₂) to burn. The purifier does not deal with either of these gases. A room with a fireplace can therefore quickly feel stale, tired and have headaches.<br><br>

• <b>Recommendation:</b> Don’t forget to <b>ventilate regularly and intensively</b>. Even a few minutes of sudden ventilation (draft) will change the air in the room without cooling the walls.<br><br>

<b>3. AIR HUMIDITY</b><br>
Stoves and fireplaces dry the air very significantly. The ideal relative humidity in the home should be between 40% and 60%. In winter, with heating, it often drops below 30%.<br><br>

• <b>Recommendation:</b> Dry air irritates mucous membranes and makes us more susceptible to respiratory irritation. Get a hygrometer and consider purchasing a <b>humidifier</b> if the humidity drops below 40%.

Enjoying the warmth of a fireplace and breathing healthy air at the same time is not a contradiction. It just requires the right technology. An air purifier designed for such an environment must be a team player: a <b>HEPA filter (H13 or “true”)</b> captures solid soot, high-quality <b>activated carbon</b> absorbs odors and gases, and technologies like <b>PlasmaWave®</b> actively help them do this.<br><br>

Winix air purifier models (certified by organizations such as ECARF for their effectiveness and suitability for sensitive people) are equipped with this comprehensive filtration technology. Combined with smart sensors, they are the ideal partner for any home where a fire is used for heating or water heating. Breathe deeply and enjoy the warmth of your home without worry.

With the arrival of winter, we naturally retreat more into the warmth of our homes, offices and public spaces. However, long hours spent in poorly ventilated rooms and more frequent contact with other people also bring a dark side – the risk of spreading viruses and bacteria increases. Closed and poorly ventilated spaces create ideal conditions for the transmission of infections. One effective tool to reduce the risk of infection is the use of an air purifier.

The quality of the air inside buildings, where we spend a large part of our time, has a fundamental impact on our health. Indoor air can contain a number of invisible pollutants that strain the respiratory system and contribute to respiratory problems. What pollutants are most commonly found in indoor air and why are they dangerous to our health?

• Viruses –  these microorganisms are easily transmitted through the air. They are contained in droplets or aerosols that are released when breathing and talking, but most often when coughing or sneezing. The most common are influenza viruses, rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, or the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

• Bacteria – single-celled organisms that, like viruses, easily spread through the air and cause respiratory infections. These include streptococci, which cause sore throats, staphylococci, which cause various infections including pneumonia, and pneumococcus, which cause pneumonia. 

• Molds – are found mainly in damp and poorly ventilated areas, but also in nature. Their spores spread easily through the air and, when inhaled, can cause allergic reactions and inflammation of the respiratory tract. In sensitive people, especially children, the elderly and people with weakened immunity, they increase the risk of infections such as sinusitis or bronchitis.

The winter months are traditionally associated with an increase in cases of infectious respiratory diseases, such as influenza, colds and COVID-19. Although these diseases can occur at any time of the year, their incidence is significantly higher in winter. What is behind this seasonal increase? A combination of several factors plays a key role.

• Lower temperatures – the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract are less hydrated in cold and dry air, which reduces their ability to defend against pathogens.

• Higher concentrations of people in enclosed spaces – poorly ventilated spaces create ideal conditions for the spread of droplet infections. In a closed environment, these droplets remain in the air longer, increasing the risk of transmitting the infection to other people.

• Weakened immunity in winter – cold weather and shorter days can have a negative impact on our immune system. One reason is that less exposure to sunlight reduces the body's levels of vitamin D, which plays an important role in supporting the immune system. Its deficiency can increase susceptibility to infections.

• Dry air – air is naturally drier in winter, and indoor heating makes this situation worse. Low humidity causes droplets containing viruses to become smaller and remain in the air longer, increasing their potential to infect humans.

• Insufficient air ventilation – viruses multiply more easily in rooms that are ventilated less frequently or insufficiently.

The air purifier removes impurities and harmful particles from the air with high efficiency. It is an invaluable aid in preventing the spread of flu and colds. It removes not only fine dust and allergens from the inhaled air, but also viruses and bacteria, which are the main causes of respiratory infections. What are the main benefits of an air purifier during flu season?

• Removes viruses and other germs from the air - the air purifier's multi-stage filtration system can capture droplets containing viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms.
  
• Reduces the spread of infections in closed spaces - ideal for homes, offices, clinics or school classrooms where there are many people together.

• Promotes a healthier environment - in addition to viruses and bacteria, the purifier also removes other pollutants, such as fine dust, allergens, smoke or harmful volatile substances, which can irritate the respiratory tract and weaken its ability to defend against infection.

• Reduces the burden on the immune system – cleaner air means fewer harmful substances that our immune system has to process. This can help the body better defend itself against viruses and bacteria.

• Activated carbon filters – absorb odors and some chemicals that can irritate the respiratory tract.

• Ultraviolet light – some purifiers are equipped with UV-C disinfection lamps that destroy the DNA or RNA of microorganisms, neutralizing them as they pass through the purifier.

• Plasma ionizer – creates a large number of negative and positive ions that bind to viruses and bacteria in the air and disrupt their cell walls, thereby neutralizing them directly in the air. They also reliably decompose various harmful gases, chemical vapors and other pollutants found indoors. Winix air purifiers are equipped with advanced PlasmaWave plasma technology.

• Choosing sufficient power – when choosing a purifier, make sure it is powerful enough for the size of the space you plan to use it in. The air output should be at least 2 times the volume of the space being cleaned.

• Proper placement of the purifier – during a cold or flu, it is important to place the air purifier in the room where the sick person spends the most time. The purifier works best in a closed room. Do not place it too close to a wall or furniture, as this may reduce airflow.

• Longer purifier operating time – for maximum efficiency, the air purifier should be turned on continuously when someone is in the room. This will not only reduce the risk of catching the flu or cold, but also improve the overall air quality in the home.

• Regular maintenance and filter replacement – ​​to ensure high filtration efficiency, it is important to replace filters regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Articulated matter refers to tiny solid and liquid particles suspended in the air. These particles are generally referred to as airborne dust. Their size ranges from a few nanometers to 10 micrometers and are mostly invisible to the naked eye.<br><br>

They can come from natural materials, but are largely created by human activity. Airborne dust is found in high concentrations in areas with heavy traffic, near industrial zones or in locations where solid fuels are used for heating.<br><br>

<i>In industrial areas, the concentration of PM particles dispersed in the air is many times higher than in rural areas.</i><br><br>

<b>PM particles are divided into three main categories based on size:</b><br><br>

• <b>PM10</b> – diameter ≤ 10 micrometers. Originates from construction, agriculture, transportation. Gets trapped in upper respiratory tract.<br>

• <b>PM2.5</b> – diameter ≤ 2.5 micrometers. Easily inhaled deeper into lungs; can enter bloodstream. Created mainly from fuel combustion.<br>

• <b>PM1</b> – diameter ≤ 1 micrometer. Most dangerous; penetrates bronchi and alveoli directly into bloodstream.

While dust particles visible to the eye do not pose a significant danger to our bodies, long-term exposure to fine microdust can cause a number of health complications, from allergies and asthma to serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.<br><br>

Dust particles often act as carriers of other carcinogenic or harmful chemicals and pollutants that can cause more serious health problems if inhaled over a long period of time. They can also carry bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory infections. It is also important to add that PM particles easily mix with allergens or viral particles and extend their existence in the air. This increases the risk of allergic reactions or infection.<br><br>

Due to these health risks, it is important to monitor and regulate the levels of PM particles in the air and take measures to reduce their concentration. Globally, this involves environmentally friendly transport, stricter emission limits, renewable energy, and improving green spaces. At home, the most effective solution is purchasing an air purifier with high-quality filtration.

An air purifier is an important addition to the household, especially in areas with heavy air pollution and in cases of allergies, asthma or other chronic respiratory diseases.<br><br>

Winix air purifiers are equipped with highly efficient HEPA filters that reliably capture up to 99.999% of harmful PM2.5 and PM10 particles from the air they inhale. Using a powerful fan, airborne impurities are sucked into the HEPA filter, where they pass through a tangle of tiny fibers. The gaps between them are so small that the filter captures all fine dust, including pollen, mold spores, dust mite allergens and bacteria.<br><br>

Although hazardous microdust cannot be seen with the naked eye, the purifier usually knows about its presence. An important part of the purifier is a sensitive dust sensor that detects the concentration of airborne dust in the room in real time. Based on the measurement, the device adjusts the cleaning performance to remove airborne dust from the air as quickly as possible.

Because dust comes from many sources, it's difficult to eliminate completely. But regular cleaning and minimizing dust sources help keep it controlled:<br><br>

• <b>Thorough cleaning</b> –  the basis is regular wiping of settled dust and vacuuming of floors and carpets with a quality vacuum cleaner with high filtration efficiency.<br>

• <b>Regular ventilation</b> – helps remove pollutants from the air and improves indoor air quality. If you live near a busy road, it is better to ventilate at night when the concentration of outdoor pollution is lower.<br>

• <b>Regular washing</b> – dust, dust mite allergens and other dirt settle in bedding, curtains and other textiles, which you can remove with regular washing.<br>

• <b>Maintain healthy humidity</b> – try to keep the air humidity in the room at an optimal value of around 50%. In the case of dry air, a humidifier will help, which reduces the dustiness of the room and makes breathing easier. If the humidity rises above 60%, a favorable environment is created for the growth of mold and the multiplication of dust mites, which also contribute to the formation of dust. In this case, a suitable solution is to purchase a dehumidifier.<br>

• <b>Limit smoking and burning</b> – smoking is one of the main sources of harmful PM particles in the home. Cigarette smoke contains a large amount of solid and gaseous substances that are proven to harm our health. Similarly, when burning wood or other solid fuels (fireplaces, stoves), a significant amount of harmful airborne dust is released into the air.
